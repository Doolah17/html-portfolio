<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>My name is Abdullah Khan. I am an analytical and detail-oriented professional with experience in customer service, software development, and bookkeeping.</p>

<p>Professionally, I have worked as a Field Technician in Drone Operations at AirMatrix, where I operated and monitored drones, collected performance metrics, and supported system optimizations. Previously, I interned as a Software Developer at AirMatrix, building a Flask app to scrape and categorize bids using AI and automation. I also worked as a Taxpayer Service Agent at the Canada Revenue Agency, and earlier as a Bookkeeper/Associate at Khalid Hasan Professional Corporation. In addition, I completed an internship as a Quality Assurance Analyst at Delphi Technology.</p>

<p>I graduated from Algonquin College with a Computer Programming Diploma in August 2025, and before that earned my Ontario Secondary School Diploma from West Carleton Secondary School. Along the way, I also obtained certifications, including a Small Basic Drone Pilot Certificate and training in BI Dashboards with Power BI.</p>

<p>Outside of my professional and academic life, I enjoy playing hockey and supporting my favorite NHL team, the Ottawa Senators.</p>
